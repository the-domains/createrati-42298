            <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ca3dcaa3-b5db-4cb2-9474-d24298b21457.png" title="HOW TO DESIGN AN APPEALING BRAND IN ONE WEEKEND" alt="Learn how to create a brand that you and your clients will love, without Photoshop or Canva, even if you don&apos;t have design or tech skills.">,<p>Have you heard of the 80/20 Pareto Principle? If you haven’t yet, I’ll have a crack at explaining it in my words (i.e., without Googling. 😉 ).<br>Basically, it’s a principle that states that 20% of our efforts produce 80% results.<br>The key is to focus on that 20% instead of the 80% work that hardly produces any results.<br>That doesn’t mean we don’t give everything our 100%, but for me, it means giving our 100% on the 20% that produces results.&nbsp;<br>I forget about this rule many times, maybe because of what I’ve been told in school, with the old ways of teaching. Even though my school was great, it was still based on old-school thinking.<br>I might get in trouble by saying this but this is similar to using Photoshop for graphic design in business.<br>It’s no wonder people get frustrated in the beginning. It really isn’t designed with the 80/20 principle in mind.<br>First, it’s not intuitive at all. I’m probably the only professional designer who can’t figure it out! lol I could never understand the layers and why I couldn’t move elements.&nbsp;<br>(And I don’t think I’m tech-challenged, I learned to love computers since I was 8 and went on to get a degree in IT!)<br>One thing I really believe in?</p>,<h2>Excellence &amp; action over perfection.</h2>,<p>To be okay with being imperfect because it will never be perfect. Things will evolve. Stuff we worry about sometimes (the 80%) just stops us from moving forward.<br>We owe ourselves and those who are waiting for us to help them, to move forward.<br>And this is why I’d love to invite you to the next live online masterclass where I’ll share with you everything I know to launch a great-looking brand in one weekend.<br>Will it be complete with your logo, website and ebooks?<br>No, because they will come later.<br>Like Lego blocks, let’s start with the core pieces then build on it as we go, as I've learned from years of trial and error and months of helping business owners build their own brands.<br>Remember that your brand will evolve and so it’s important to focus on the 20%, which is to at least launch your opt-in landing page so that you can start growing a customer base even before you create your website.<br>Some things that we’ll be covering:&nbsp;</p>,<ul><li><strong>How to create a memorable &amp; recognisable brand by choosing the right colours, fonts, and graphical elements fast</strong>. One that attracts your dream clients, conveys your message, and feels like you.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>How to create a beautiful lead magnet, opt-in page and prepare your first email campaign template so you can start building your list</strong>(which we all know successful online entrepreneurs do!), in simple, easy, step-by-step walkthrough.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>How to create beautiful social media graphics so you can start promoting and growing your list</strong>, without Photoshop or Canva, so that you can finally go to market with your idea, even if you don't have a product or website yet.&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Plus...<strong>free surprise bonuses when you show up LIVE</strong>!</li></ul>,<p>We’ll cover all of this in an action-packed live masterclass where you can also ask me questions while we work through the entire process, completely free!<br>It's not for everyone, but if you’ve hired designers or outsourced your design and it didn’t work out, or if you have an idea but you still haven’t launched it to the world, then I think you’ll learn cool new methods in this masterclass, that just might work when no other methods have.<br>Are you in?&nbsp;</p>,<p>Click below to find out the details and register for my next <em>live</em> masterclass where you get to ask me any question or get help with anything you’re struggling with!</p>,<a href="http://take.thebrandtour.com/masterclass" data-role="cta">Click here to register &amp; save your spot in the masterclass</a>,<iframe src="https://the-grid.github.io/ed-userhtml/?g=eJyVVM1u2kAQvucpJlyjxSZqq8qiqQoFGikSESKVeorW9sZe1Xis3XUoN96hl1RKX44n6eyaUDvCpuXALjM73_fNH8NzxuBW5kYooQ0sZJTanxoYuzo7G66E4RAhuXPzYbf9xZWRUSboBoXCQiizsWZMArMprNk7RIkfhQpqoTE3PChQm76R5jjE3k4YwzCQD5Y4PoSGGSZ9i_xZ6EjJwkjMyXfVRdcS85o4bngrepFp4XWCx_-J6dmcTsstVXYErrJ2C3LhbcXV0oj7nK_ESRjXI16aFNVrnH37g4P3H5CMXNFk8VXRBlaUYSZ1KuJ7-7QOWsMb3cxnsJzfXo9326ejMFpEjQZmiAU88qwUuiko4yE116p55Mq6nOHUKLlH_X0BjwowPPnbactOt_Pd9idM8vjoipGPtgXoU_EeQHv7feodKtDbk_SA8NsibOdrIV9wDUuEcYqoBUzJrOHCnTDGVShzbuul4U7LPIEZYpK9PJuigm9YKhiV5BRaAxlGNF5d_LWJr6mYLiYTWN4t54vrTzcBWFEGIapEPexF2ZNCViFquivYWO7whXstQju9VoMdcSidYGLOmaaHkWiI73-VsUBYu1EwdKrvH20yEPEceKbJxQ21QBpIqSP9rpRo62qppMYUgee5NRMySU2EKhdK9yP0Ulwzg6zKi7m83DeLaqVmTjlLnNrqkddFf9jZXm0VnieWmlrouF1XdtvfbSjHl6yW1KU_eMP892xwufT9wB8Eb99d2IvfKqz5J9CQNlOCSitymCupGU1eTtqeCegP0_5zuA" height="244"></iframe>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Are you using the right colours for your brand?]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/90a0f7f5-6d52-46c1-9a5a-e1637e886589.jpg">,<h1>Are you using the right colours for your brand?</h1>,<p>I spent most of the weekend just taking in lots of inspiration (I find that headspace and lots of eye candy helps the creative mind, and no it's not just caffeine ) and I can't wait to share them with you!</p>,<p>From the wonderful Lunar New Year celebrations here in Melbourne to the unreal yet uber-inspiring Australian Open tennis final with Federer and Nadal. (Two of the top tennis champs in our lifetime!)</p>,<p>I just loved how generous, gracious, and tenacious both legends are.</p>,<p>Most of all, how Federer and Nadal leveraged their own strengths, which they used to conquer the other’s weaknesses.</p>,<p>Nadal used power and spin on his shots, targeting Federer’s weak backhand, and how Federer used wit and persistence to target Nadal’s backhand issues as well.<br>Which made me think a lot about branding and visual identity.</p>,<p>We all have something in us and in our businesses that separate us from others. <br>Nadal had power, Federer had tactics. What's yours?</p>,<p>Can't think of any? No worries!</p>,<h2>3 quick questions to help you refine your branding</h2>,<p>1. What makes you angry and annoyed in your industry? What is it about your industry you’d like to change? (Source: Seth Godin)<br>2. What are your weaknesses? Can you somehow turn them into strengths? (Source: Daymond John)<br>3. How can you tie both in to your brand’s visual identity?<br>As for me, I don’t like how design and creativity is perceived by many as a talent or gift for the select few.</p>,<p>How it sometimes can feel elitist, unattainable, impossible.</p>,<p>My weaknesses? I’m an unknown, self-taught designer with no prestigious awards or degrees from a leading university. I’m not even a veteran yet in any sense of the word. <br>I’m also an introvert so thinking about PR and video gives me the hives.</p>,<p>But I’ve found ways to get around this by keeping things simple, to get creative every day, and to continually strive for excellence.</p>,<h2>Simplicity, creativity and excellence.</h2>,<p>That’s why my brand just consists of black (sometimes near-black navy) and white for simplicity, pale gold and silver for excellence, and bright purple to add a hint of creativity and playfulness. <br>Also, there’s a bit of rebellion against design being commoditised so I added the premium touches. Can’t mistake me from Fiverr now! ;)<br>Your turn! Let me know what yours are, I'd love to know.</p>,<p>Still stuck picking colours? Got great news for you!</p>,<p>Over the next few weeks, I’ll be introducing colours to you in a bit of an unconventional way.</p>,<p>Sure, there’s colour psychology charts out there (just check out Pinterest) that kinda give you an idea, but my problem with them is that they are too general.</p>,<p>For instance, they say blue is for trust, efficiency, intelligence. But there’s so many shades of blue — did you pick the right shade?</p>,<p>What about the right combo?</p>,<p>(Oh, and in case you’re wondering, my favourite reference for stunning colour combinations? <a href="http://bit.ly/therealhue" title="">Check it out: The Real Hue: What You Didn’t Know About Colour.</a>)<br>Excited? I know I am. ;)</p>,<p>Is there a specific colour you want to get to know first?</p>,<img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/5e971b17a7f5b6cff4bdf9ad5307d3fd/croprotate.png?cropheight=1484&cropwidth=718&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F0ca1bc12-4bc6-4d15-baee-2fa2fb895b7f.png&x=9&y=9">]]></description>
