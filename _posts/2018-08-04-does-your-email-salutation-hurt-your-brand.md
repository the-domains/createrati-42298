# Does Your Email Salutation Hurt Your Brand?

> Shake things up. It's ok to be polarising. It's what separates the gold from the sand.

I came across a Facebook post about how offensive it was to be called "lady boss" or "gorgeous" in a newsletter.

The majority of those who chimed in on the thread found it offensive. Not surprising. ;)

I would usually scroll through and let it slide, as all the others who don't let tiny things like these get to them probably would.

Except for one woman spoke up. She said she was too busy in her business to get offended by things like these.

I thought in that moment...what if there were new entrepreneurs reading the thread, confused enough by conflicting advice?

Be yourself. Be authentic, is what they say. And yet here we are seeing negativity for when we do.

What if you're known to call people "Hi, beautiful" or "Hi, babe" in real life?

If I was the confused, overwhelmed entreprenur I was 3 years ago and I came across the thread, it would have discouraged me to be just what I need to be: myself.

Then I'd be just like everyone else.

So I asked myself a few questions:

### What do my favourite brands do? What do my mentors do? Would my best customers mind?

Apple and Manolo don't really address me as anything...they just show me images of products with my name on it.

Foursigmatic calls me a "Mushroom Friend". Frank Body calls me "babe".

I don't identify with either but I think they're fun.

Last but not least, one of my treasured friends and mentor calls her tribe "Gorgeous" in her much-loved newsletters and all her branding materials.

She calls everyone gorgeous in real life. It's not being patronising. 

It's an endearment, she's one of the most generous and affectionate souls I know. 

I think it's also partly because she really does see the gorgeous bits in all of us. She didn't get the "mutant eyes" nickname for nothing.

What's even more interesting is that her tribe is the most generous and most accepting people I've ever met. 

Both online and real life.

Everyone is positive, encouraging, supportive, honest and genuine.

They're smart, brave, inspiring, with quick wit and a great sense of humour.

They don't get offended easily. 

Of course you can expect there'd be the occasional objection. Often, it's a sign that they won't be part of the tribe.

So call them the way you normally would call the people you serve, who love you.

### Done right, your email salutation just might be the "tribal call" you need to find more of those who need you.

If it doesn't bring you more of them, then keep trying, keep looking for the one that does.

In case you're wondering, I like being called gorgeous. I don't take it as being objectified. 

I grew up not hearing much terms of endearment so it warms my heart when I do hear it.

In fact I remember a time back in school, a teacher used it and it brought me to tears. It made me feel loved.

But it's all relative. Maybe if I grew up hearing that in a patronising tone, I'd feel differently.

### I, for one, haven't yet found a salutation or greeting that fits my brand.

I know I can't use "gorgeous" or "babe", it's just not me. 

Maybe when I'm older, I'll use darling. I quite like that. I'm sure those who matter won't mind it either.

For now, I'll just start my emails with Hi or Hey.

### At the end of the day, nobody really has the right answers. 

It's all about finding the one that's right for you and the people you serve.
