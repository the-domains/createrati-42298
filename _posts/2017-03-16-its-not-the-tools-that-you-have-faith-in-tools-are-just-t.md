# Wordpress vs Squarespace: For Blog or Business

## The Single Reason Why You Should Choose One Over The Other

### "It's not the tools that you have faith in, tools are just tools. They work, or they don't work." ~Steve Jobs

I've seen this question over and over: Squarespace vs Wordpress: which one is best?

I think that the question could be better asked this way: which platform brings you the most joy? Let me explain.

Starting an online business is tough. There's so much to learn, so many decisions to make. Even just choosing a platform can take a business owner days---if not weeks---to decide on. Why do we make it all so complicated? Are we procrastinating out of fear?

I've had the same dilemma. For years, in fact.

A few years ago when I first dreamed about becoming a travel blogger, I did my research and found that the most successful bloggers recommended Wordpress. My favourite fashion/travel bloggers used Wordpress.

So I followed their lead: Wordpress it is.   
Then what happened was a downward spiral of platform mania. I switched to Blogger, then switched back to Wordpress, tried Ghost, then Wordpress, then Tumblr, then Medium, back to Wordpress.

It was like a bad addiction that I kept recurring to...so one day, I went cold turkey.  
After some meditation and much-needed hiatus from all things social media and the Internet, like life, I realised one thing from a KonMari decluttering session: that everything in life, even your choice of tools for your business, just all boils down to one question: Which one brings you joy.

Back to the topic at hand: should you go with Wordpress vs Squarespace?  
Instead of succumbing to the overly biased comparison articles.I'm sure you've seen them: when you read a paragraph or land on their site and instantly know which direction the article is going to lean towards.

If you're caught unawares, this could lead you to confirmation bias. Which may or may not work in your favour depending on whether you're using logic vs intuition.

So here are a few things you might want to first ask yourself before making a choice:

1. Are you planning to start a blog?
2. Do you want something simple or fully customisable?
3. Do you like tinkering with technology?
4. Do you tinker with technology as some sort of procrastination?
5. Do you really plan on writing regularly on your blog?

## **Are you planning to start a blog?**

I ask this because there's one thing that Wordpress is king of: blogs.

It was originally meant for blogs. And will remain dominating as a blogging platform.

If not? Then please stay away.

Sure, you'll see websites that you'd never think was built on Wordpress but I smell a Wordpress site when I see one. There's something that's not very fluid with how it works, how it scrolls.

Even the best sites feel like an all-purpose knife that's been crafted by the most skilled blacksmiths into a samurai.

Or like Cinderella and her beautiful coach. You still know that underneath the surface magic, it's still a pumpkin.

Looks great! But someone who has at least trained or tried to do the same will know what really happened (and we're probably talking at least half of online entrepreneurs).

Squarespace, however? It's been built as a samurai from the start. Sometimes a trainee craftsman might butcher it a bit, like I have in the beginning (as I like to learn things by pushing its boundaries), but you'll still know it used to be a samurai.

When you want a blog and be able to do lots of things with it, then an all-purpose knife is what you need.

Which brings us to our next point.

## **Do you want something simple or fully customisable?**

Like I mentioned earlier about all-purpose knives, because Wordpress is an open-source platform, meaning anyone can look inside and tinker with it however they want.

For a lot of people, that's a good thing.

Here's why that was dangerous for me: open source meant endless possibilities, unlimited plugins, unending security holes.

After a while, I realised that I left IT for the exact same reasons.

And I wanted to build a life where I didn't have to be kept up at night thinking about the vulnerabilities.

Yet here I was worrying about them again.

For most Wordpress fans, this level of control is great. Not so much for me.

As a business owner, I knew I had better decisions to make than when to install those updates. Or whether or not they'd break when I do. Or what the risks are if I don't.

At that point, I let go of the control and chose a platform that did all the updates for me. I just didn't want to do any of that myself.

I just wanted to create. And keep my life simple.

With technology? It can go either way. Which segues into our next question.

## **Do you like tinkering with technology?**

If it's a yes, then Wordpress is your platform. However, it's not that simple. At least not in my case.

I love technology, which was what led me to IT in the first place.

Yet like that addiction I told you about? I love it so much that I ended up being obsessed with tinkering that I forgot to blog. Which was the main reason I had a Wordpress site.

And this is why I ask the next question...

## **Do you tinker with technology as some sort of procrastination?**

I know I did. I went down that rabbit hole of finding the perfect plugins.

And figuring out how to move the sidebar to the left because apparently that helps conversions.

I wanted to integrate them all so that when I write a post they all automatically published into all my social media accounts.

That is, when I actually got around to creating posts.

Which brings us to our final question...

## **Do you really plan on writing regularly on your blog?**

At this point I realised that I loved tinkering and designing my blog rather than actually...err...blogging.

I got an opportunity to co-found an app on Startup Weekend, got attention on my designs. One of my first business websites got featured on Strikingly. Shortly after that, I landed my first web design client.

And the rest is history.

## **What all these questions really boiled down to for me is this: which platform gives me joy?**

I was never happy with Wordpress which was why I had this off-again, on-again relationship.

Something about it felt too much like Windows over Mac.

I will never forget that first moment I went to an IT show, with an intention to buy a PC.

I got overwhelmed with too many options: Toshiba, Fujitsu, Asus.

I decided to go home and research.

On my way out, I walked past the Apple booth. I don't know why I didn't see it before---it was huge.

I guess at the time, I didn't see it as an option as everyone told me to get a PC.

It felt premium, like it was way out of my league.

Which was ridiculous because when I got closer, the prices were cheaper than the PC I was looking to get.

They also gave me just two options: Macbook or a Macbook Pro? Then two colours.

The day I switched, I never looked back.

That feeling I had then was nothing short of joy.

"The more constraints one imposes, the more one frees one's self." ~ Igor Stravinsky

Almost a decade later, I'm writing this on my Mac, on Google Docs (despite all these recommendations to use Evernote, Scrivener or Ulysses).

Sure, sometimes I wish there were features here and there, but at the end of the day, all I want to do is just write. Yet I know that options and features distract and confuse me.

That's why I'm going with simple tools that let me do this one thing: write this piece to reach those of you who have gone through the same dilemma as I have.

These tools, however simple, both bring me joy.

And that's the single best reason why I chose them.

It's the single reason why I'm able to contribute to the world today.

So when you're choosing a platform, whether it's Wordpress or Squarespace, I suggest to take them both for a test drive.

There's no one platform for everyone, but there's one platform for us.

Like finding "the one", your soulmate.

Choose the one that brings you joy.

If it doesn't work out, at least you'll know.

Maybe, like me, you'll also get to know a little more about yourself, too.

Wondering which platforms I eventually live happily ever after with?

In the end, I went with Strikingly. Now I use IMXPRS + TheGrid (more on this later).

And for my clients? Shopify or Squarespace.
