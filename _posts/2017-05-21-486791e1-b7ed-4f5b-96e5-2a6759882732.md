Have you heard of the 80/20 Pareto Principle? If you haven't yet, I'll have a crack at explaining it in my words (i.e., without Googling. ðŸ˜‰ ).  
Basically, it's a principle that states that 20% of our efforts produce 80% results.  
The key is to focus on that 20% instead of the 80% work that hardly produces any results.  
That doesn't mean we don't give everything our 100%, but for me, it means giving our 100% on the 20% that produces results.   
I forget about this rule many times, maybe because of what I've been told in school, with the old ways of teaching. Even though my school was great, it was still based on old-school thinking.  
I might get in trouble by saying this but this is similar to using Photoshop for graphic design in business.  
It's no wonder people get frustrated in the beginning. It really isn't designed with the 80/20 principle in mind.  
First, it's not intuitive at all. I'm probably the only professional designer who can't figure it out! lol I could never understand the layers and why I couldn't move elements.   
(And I don't think I'm tech-challenged, I learned to love computers since I was 8 and went on to get a degree in IT!)  
One thing I really believe in?

## Excellence & action over perfection.

To be okay with being imperfect because it will never be perfect. Things will evolve. Stuff we worry about sometimes (the 80%) just stops us from moving forward.  
We owe ourselves and those who are waiting for us to help them, to move forward.  
And this is why I'd love to invite you to the next live online masterclass where I'll share with you everything I know to launch a great-looking brand in one weekend.  
Will it be complete with your logo, website and ebooks?  
No, because they will come later.  
Like Lego blocks, let's start with the core pieces then build on it as we go, as I've learned from years of trial and error and months of helping business owners build their own brands.  
Remember that your brand will evolve and so it's important to focus on the 20%, which is to at least launch your opt-in landing page so that you can start growing a customer base even before you create your website.  
Some things that we'll be covering: 

* **How to create a memorable & recognisable brand by choosing the right colours, fonts, and graphical elements fast**. One that attracts your dream clients, conveys your message, and feels like you. 
* **How to create a beautiful lead magnet, opt-in page and prepare your first email campaign template so you can start building your list**(which we all know successful online entrepreneurs do!), in simple, easy, step-by-step walkthrough. 
* **How to create beautiful social media graphics so you can start promoting and growing your list**, without Photoshop or Canva, so that you can finally go to market with your idea, even if you don't have a product or website yet. 
* Plus...**free surprise bonuses when you show up LIVE**!

We'll cover all of this in an action-packed live masterclass where you can also ask me questions while we work through the entire process, completely free!  
It's not for everyone, but if you've hired designers or outsourced your design and it didn't work out, or if you have an idea but you still haven't launched it to the world, then I think you'll learn cool new methods in this masterclass, that just might work when no other methods have.  
Are you in?
