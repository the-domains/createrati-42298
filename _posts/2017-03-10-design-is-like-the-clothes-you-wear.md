# Design is like the clothes you wear.

This week, I organised a little workshop and got the dates confused following a change, and emails that were queued originally got sent out even after I made the corrections. 

### **Embarrassing? Yes.**

## **Regrettable? No.**

Why? Because I realised that all the mistakes I made were a result of my taking action.

Like finally getting out a live online workshop that I've been resisting/planning for years.

I did it under the radar because I knew the first time will be messy.

And it was.

But the best lesson? 

It made me realise that I want to focus on things that people will remember years after I've done it.

Not things that are fleeting and trivial...like getting the dates wrong or sending out the wrong email.

I'm sure nobody's going to say, "Oh yeah, Gretchen's that girl that keeps getting these dates wrong in her emails. Even when she used to work in IT."

Maybe someone will, but that person's probably not the one I'm trying to reach.

I want to reach those that would say:

"There's this goofy girl, I forget her name, but she said this:

> "Design is like the clothes you wear---what you say, think and do in addition to how you're dressed is what makes your whole brand. That's what people's gonna remember you by."

Or something along those lines. ;) 

### How would you like people to remember you?

I'd love to know. That, or if there's been something else you've been pondering about. 

I crave introspective conversations like these, it's a shame that we just don't do it often enough.

Luckily, it's the weekend soon. And we can just blame it all on the wine. ;)
