# Colour Personality: Could Fresh Green be your match?

Doing anything Valentine's Day?

Whether or not you celebrate it, let's have fun with it! ;)

Introducing...Colour Matchmaking series. 

---

This is a little experiment on doing a little spin on the whole colour psychology thing...we're going to give them life!

How it works? If you're not sure what colour to use, keep an eye out on this series to find your true match. The One.

I'll wait for them to come to me and I'll introduce them to you.

In the form of a personal dating ad.

Crazy? Weird? Guilty as charged.

But as David Ogilvy once said:

> The best ideas come as jokes. Make your thinking as funny as possible.

So let's get on with it! Ready?  
Imagine the following as a personal ad in a newspaper, old-school style:

---

## **WILL YOU BE MY VALENTINE?**

You: You're quite **optimistic, vivacious and you love life**. You **love the outdoors**. Your ideal day would be a picnic in the garden, surrounded by lush green grass, sparkling with dew as the **sun grazes the surface of every leaf and blade**. You love connecting with people, are in great health.

Your favourite drink is the mojito --- you love **freshness** and **energy**.

You love fresh, **organic vegetables** whenever you can get them. You probably have a juicer. You could even be a vegetarian, or at least, at some point, you contemplated going vegan. Then you realised **life is too short for that shit**. You should be able to eat and do what you want, and **get the most out of life**!

Except, of course, when you know it would hurt the **planet**. You do your part in recycling. Though sometimes you still hesitate which bin a paper cup goes into: paper or recyclables? Aren't they the same? Why can't they make life simpler?

You've thrown out most of the plastic in your home, though you know that you can only do so much.

Because practically 90% of the modern world is made up of these petrochemicals. Slowly killing every living thing on this planet. Let's not even get started on processed food and wheat.

Really, paper straws are fine. You should be able to finish your drink before it disintegrates.

Balloons are cute especially when they fly into the big blue sky. Most people don't realise that they have to come down at some stage. If they don't end up in the sea right away, those that don't find their way to the landfill end up in the sea. In the stomachs of those beautiful, helpless turtles and other creatures in the sea. Like cigarette butts.

As if it couldn't get any worse, they start using hard plastic handles on balloons. Do they not realise these are even worse than straws? What's wrong with good, old-fashioned biodegradable strings?!

I know, I know, you get **passionate about all these things but only because you love life**. And everything in this planet. I (will) love that about you and how you're so cute when you get all worked up.

Me: I've won awards like this year's **Pantone Colour of the Year**. They call me "**Greenery**". I got a special mention from **[Etsy][0]** as well. I'm related to the royals, a descendant of **His Highness Emerald Green I**. You may have heard of him. If not, you'll get to meet him one day.

I've been known to be **jealous** and **envious** at times, but that would be my older uncle, Retro Green. He's a bit darker than I am, and a little less saturated. He's also what people call the colour of sick (sorry, TMI). He's a bit old-school.

I'm **lighter and brighter**, but without looking electric, like my crazy cousin Chartreuse.  
To see what our gorgeous future family might look like, click [here][1]: COLOR OF THE YEAR 2017 - Greenery\] or to find the absolute best ones, just grab a copy of [The Real Hue: What You Didn't Know About Colour][2].

If you think we could be a good match, look me up.   
Love always,  
**Fresh Green**
