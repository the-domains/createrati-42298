# On the importance of Negative Space...in design and life.

" **in a world filled with chaos and clutter, clean design stands out**."

---

The Australian Open is here in Melbourne and I just watched one German tennis player (whom I've never heard of), slam one of my favourite players: Andy Murray.

What I found interesting was that the German player (He-Whose-Name-I-Can't-Pronounce :P, Mischa Zverev) seemed completely unfazed, despite playing against the defending world's number one. Most players would get pretty nervous just by that thought.

**Yet He-Whose-Name-I-Can't-Pronounce remained calm the whole time**, not letting fear crowd his mind as he went on to win the match.

In a **memorable performance that made people stand up and take notice.**

NEGATIVE SPACE

This made me realise (yet again) **the importance of negative space in life**. How important it is to maintain space in our thoughts and lives, to **make way for greater things: like standing out and standing up to your biggest competition**.

Coincidentally, I recently wrote about negative space on **[the blog][0]**, along with some tips on how I design with it and around it.

I'm a huge fan of negative space, because **in a world filled with chaos and clutter, clean design stands out**.

Negative space breaks the pattern, clearing the way into your audience's attention span, making space for the fundamentals: **expressing your core message, creating that emotional connection with your audience, and guiding them clearly to the one thing you want them to do, that will very likely change their lives**: to click the button to your call-to-action (be it to sign up to your mailing list or to download a product).

So you can help change their lives.
